Rust sshidentify
================

The Rust `sshidentify` can be used to gain information about the
SSH key, that has been used for the current connection. There are
two different ways to get this:

1. `get_ssh_exposeauth_info()`

This is available when the crate is build with the "exposeauth"
feature. The function is only usable if OpenSSH has ExposeAuthInfo
enabled in `sshd_config`. Note, that the default of that option
is disabled. Using this way is usually preferred.

2. `get_ssh_journal_info()`

This is available when the crate is build with the "journal"
feature. The function will traverse through the process tree to
find the parent sshd PID. Once found the PID is being used to check
the systemd journal for the key fingerprint having been used for
the connection. Last but not least the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` is
being examined to find the public key for the fingerprint.

NOTE: The resulting binary must be called with permissions to
access the system's systemd journal to be functional.

Examples
========

```rust
fn main() {
	let info = sshidentify::get_ssh_exposeauth_info().unwrap()
    println!("SSH Info: {:?}", info);
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
	let info = sshidentify::get_ssh_journal_info().unwrap()
    println!("SSH Info: {:?}", info);
}
```

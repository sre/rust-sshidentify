Rust sshidentify
================

The Rust `sshidentify` can be used to gain information about the
SSH key, that has been used for the current connection. The
public `get_ssh_info()` will traverse through the process tree
to find the parent sshd PID. Once found the PID is being used
to check the systemd journal for the key fingerprint having been
used for the connection. Last but not least the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
is being examined to find the public key for the fingerprint.

NOTE: The resulting binary must be called with permissions to
access the system's systemd journal to be functional.

Examples
========

```rust
extern crate sshidentify;

/// Print information about first gpiochip
fn main() {
	let info = sshidentify::get_ssh_info().unwrap()
    println!("SSH Info: {:?}", info);
}
```
